>>>>>>>>>GitIgnore<<<<<<<<<<<

let consider we have a project which have n number of files like file 1,2,3,4,...

then let's assume there is one of these files, we don't wnat to add in git or don't keep track of that file.


make a file and save with .gitignore
inside that write a name of file/folder we don't need to keep track of.
for e.g
write index.html inside .gitignore file and index.html will be out of track of the git system.

*.log => ignores all the file with the extension .log
demo/ => ignores the demo folder.
*.css
*.js


git init
git status
git add --a // git add.
git commit -m "first commit"

>>>>>>>>>LifeCycle of file status in GIT<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

>>>>
git diff => compares modified file to the staged file.
git diff --staged => compares straged file to last commit.

>>>>>>How to skip staging area and directly commit<<<<<<<
git commit -a -m "changes in the file1"
 files have to be staged at least once.
 
 >>>>>>>How to unstage and unmodify<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
 
 after 
 git add file1.txt
then 
git restore --staged file1.txt then it'll be unstaged.


for unmodify
git restore file1.txt

for restoring all at once=>(git checkout -f)/(git checkout file3.txt)

>>>>>>>>>>rename and moving a file in git<<<<<<<
git mv file3.txt file4.txt(renamed)
git rm file2.txt (deleted)

git rm --cached file3.txt(.gitignore) because it was prevoiusly staged so it cache needs to be removed.
